  abstract = {Binary choice tasks, such as 2-alternative forced choice, show a complex yet consistent pattern of sequential effects, whereby responses and response times depend on the detailed pattern of prior stimuli going back at least 5 trials. We show this pattern is well explained by simultaneous incremental learning of 2 simple statistics of the trial sequence: the base rate and the repetition rate. Both statistics are learned by the same basic associative mechanism, but they contribute different patterns of sequential effects because they entail different representations of the trial sequence. Subtler aspects of the data that are not explained by these 2 learning processes alone are explained by their interaction, via learning from joint error correction. Specifically, the cue-competition mechanism that has explained classic findings in animal learning (e.g., blocking) appears to operate on learning of sequence statistics. We also find that learning of the base rate and repetition rate are dissociated into response and stimulus processing, respectively, as indicated by event-related potentials, manipulations of stimulus discriminability, and reanalysis of past experiments that eliminated stimuli or prior responses. Thus, sequential effects in these tasks appear to be driven by learning the response base rate and the stimulus repetition rate. Connections are discussed between these findings and previous research attempting to separate stimulus- and response-based sequential effects, and research using sequential effects to determine mental representations. We conclude that sequential effects offer a powerful means for uncovering representations and learning mechanisms.},

  abstract = {We introduce EMC2, an R package for the Bayesian hierarchical analysisof cognitive models of choice. EMC2 bridges the gap between standardregression analyses and cognitive modeling through linear-model specifica-tions for each type of cognitive-model parameter. The flexible implemen-tation of the linear modelling language allows users to map model parame-ters directly to complicated designs and hypotheses. EMC2 implementsrecent developments in Bayesian parameter estimation and hypothesistesting, including powerful and efficient sampling and marginal likelihoodestimation algorithms, so it is computationally feasible to estimate manydifferent cognitive models, and perform inference among them. Using twoleading evidence-accumulation models, we illustrate how EMC2 providesa workflow that makes it easy to specify diverse parameterisations and in-formative priors, and to evaluate, refine, compare, and interpret models.},

  abstract = {Sequences of choice response times exhibit ubiquitous and strong multiscale dynamics (i.e., sequential dependencies across a broad range of temporal scales). Despite their pervasive nature, multiscale dynamics are poorly understood. We show that dynamics in the seconds to minutes range can be explained by the superposition of several distinct learning and control mechanisms. Each mechanism learns a representation of the structure of the choice environment and/or an aspect of the decision-maker's ability. These representations are updated after each choice and used to control the next decision by modulating the parameters of an evidence accumulation process with subsecond range dynamics that determine individual choices. We link these mechanisms to three major foci in the experimental study of sequential dependencies: stimulus history, error-related, and hard--easy effects. This account provides a detailed explanation of both multiscale dynamics of choice sequences, and the three effects, at the group and individual levels.},

    abstract = {Recent analyses of serial correlations in cognitive tasks have provided preliminary evidence of the presence of a particular form of long-range serial dependence known as 1/f noise. It has been argued that long-range dependence has been largely ignored in mainstream cognitive psychology even though it accounts for a substantial proportion of variability in behavior (see, e.g., Gilden, 1997, 2001). In this article, we discuss the defining characteristics of long-range dependence and argue that claims about its presence need to be evaluated by testing against the alternative hypothesis of short-range dependence. For the data from three experiments, we accomplish such tests with autoregressive fractionally integrated moving-average time series modeling. We find that long-range serial dependence in these experiments can be explained by any of several mechanisms, including mixtures of a small number of short-range processes.
